# Fitness-tracker
The goal of this project is to develop a fitness tracker that helps users monitor their physical activity, health metrics, and overall fitness journey. The fitness tracker will record essential data such as steps taken, calories burned, heart rate, distance traveled, sleep patterns, and other relevant health indicators. 

Overview

The Fitness Tracker is a wearable device and mobile application designed to monitor physical activities and health metrics. The system provides real-time tracking of steps, calories burned, distance traveled, heart rate, sleep patterns, and more. This data is presented in a user-friendly interface to help users track their fitness progress and achieve their health goals.

Features

Step Tracking: Tracks the number of steps taken throughout the day.
Distance Tracking: Measures the distance covered during walking, running, or cycling.
Calories Burned: Calculates calories burned based on activity and personal metrics.
Heart Rate Monitoring: Tracks heart rate throughout the day and during exercise.
Sleep Tracking: Monitors sleep duration and quality, including deep, light, and REM stages.
Goal Setting: Users can set personal fitness goals (steps, calories, distance).
Progress Reports: Provides weekly and monthly reports to visualize progress.
Integration: Syncs with popular fitness apps (Google Fit, Apple Health, etc.).
Badges & Rewards: Earn virtual badges for achieving fitness milestones.
