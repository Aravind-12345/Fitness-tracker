# Fitness-tracker
The goal of this project is to develop a fitness tracker that helps users monitor their physical activity, health metrics, and overall fitness journey. The fitness tracker will record essential data such as steps taken, calories burned, heart rate, distance traveled, sleep patterns, and other relevant health indicators.
